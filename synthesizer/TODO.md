- test 
	- char only mutate to first option

- train templates
	- template: a (incomplete) program a LHS can mutate into
		e.g. [re -> star char star char star char star] (can be useful in matching ipv4)
	- find a way to measure better template overall during training (more templates may even slow down the search)
	- find a way to measure probability of an LHS during search

- Improve constant performance
	- the checking speed is wayyyyyyyyy too slow
