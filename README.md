# What is this?
* *NetQRE* is a high level networking domain specific programing language for quantitative analysis through regular expressions.
* `compiler-native` contains the original implementation of NetQRE.
* `data-transducer` contains a basic implementation of Data Transducer, a generalized model of NFA which supports quantitative computations.
* `netqre2dt` contains a complier from NetQRE to data-transducer, which is expected to be faster than native implementation.
* `synthesizer` contains a code generator of NetQRE from labelled examples.

For usage instruction, see `synthesizer/README.md`.
